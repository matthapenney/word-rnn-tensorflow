# word-rnn-tensorflow
Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) in Python w/ TensorFlow - word-level language model

Followed Max Deutsch's guide on 'How to write with artifical intelligence' to generate text.  Mostly reused code from https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

#Initial Usage
Train with initial parameters on Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park, run:
```bash
python train.py
```

Sample from trained model"
```bash
python sample.py
```
